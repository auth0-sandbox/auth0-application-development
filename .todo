Module 02
    - Change the settings page of the API with the right audience, maybe make the description just mention the audience.
    - The second permission should really be read:expenses throughout, but that is a big change.
    - 5-12 Reduce or eliminate the big note
    - 5-13 maybe goes away
    - 5-14 be clearer about where the code is (improve 5-12)
    - 5-15 clarify


Module 05? MFA
    - Add ACR: acr_values with the authentication request, claim or scope that the level was achieved


Did we change the callback URLs properly in module 3?
