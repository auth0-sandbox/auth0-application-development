# Lab 2: API Access Management

[**Table of Contents**](./appdev-workspace.md)

## Synopsis

This lab goes through the steps of integrating an application with Auth0 for authentication and authorization.
This project chooses to use NodeJS as the platform to run a JavaScript web service.
Experienced programmers will have a low learning curve to switch to JavaScript, and it
will be necessary to use JavaScript for the single-page applications anyway.
*Express* is chosen as the embedded web server framework to process HTTP requests in NodeJS.
Express is similar to Flask or FastAPI in Python, Spring in Java, or Kestrel (part of ASP.NET Core) in .NET.
Along the way the features of the Auth0 express-openid-connect SDK will be explored;
the basic functionality of Auth0 Web Application SDKs is similar across all the platforms.
